# SpeakingClock - My First Own Project
Application obtains the current time from the system clock, 
converts hours/minutes/seconds into its word-counterparts 
and displays the result in the window (polish version only).
Application allows you also to listen to the current time (polish version only).
There are 3 options: displaying the result, listening to the result and combining both of them.
I`ve used JavaFX framework.

There were surely few bugs I didn`t manage to fix yet.

Project #01.
